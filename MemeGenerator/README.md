# MemeGenerator

MemeGenerator is a project for the Intermediate Python Course in Udacity.  

It is a multimedia app that generates memes (an image overlaid with a quote) - either from stock data or via user input.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt in the virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requirements.txt
```
### Install pdftotext
To read the text from PDF files, you need to install [pdftotext](https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html).

For MacOS:

- Install Brew (A Package Manager for MacOS):

```$/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```
- run ```brew install pkg-config poppler python```
- run ```pip install pdftotext```


## Interface

To get started, you have two options:
1) Run ```python3 meme.py```:
- If no input, the program generates a random image and quote and saves it in the ```./tmp``` folder.

- To create a bespoke Meme, you have the option to add the following to the command line interface (CLI) of ```python3 meme.py```:
--path (local)
--body
--author

2) Run ```python3 app.py``` to start the flask web server
at local host ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ```
- Pressing the Random button will continue creating new Memes.
- Or press the Creator button and enter your own image, text and author details.
- All Memes are stored in the ```./static``` folder.
